	<h2>About this site</h2>
	<p>
		About a year ago, One of my website <a href="www.try-free-sample.com">try-free-sample.com</a>
		went down because of some server error. I realised it only after few
		days. I fixed the site as soon as I found out but it has already done
		a bad damage.My site lost its usual traffic and it has been hard to
		recover.
